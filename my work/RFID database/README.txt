Project:
1. Register RFID with serial number and add entry into database on server.
2. Once the RFID has accepted a serial number, tag it
twice at every work station. Once 'in' and 'out'. Out tagging will enter the elapsed time into the database.

To write serial number the Station variable has to be set 
as St0 and for workstation the station can be set to StX.

The devices talk to the local server so set that as the ipaddress.s
